# Source Mobile
> An app for SPS students to access their grades

The [website for the SPS source](https://ps.seattleschools.org) is not responsive and a pain to use on a mobile device. This app, written in [Flutter](https://flutter.io), serves as a cross-platform method for reading grades much more easily.
